\section*{Acknowlegment}
First of all, I would like to thank my supervisor, Prof. Dr. Stefanie Scherzinger, for giving me the opportunity to do my master's thesis under her chair. I am grateful for her guidance, valuable insights, and feedback, which have greatly improved the quality of my thesis.

I also wish to honour my father, who sadly passed away in December 2024 after an eleven-month battle with cancer. He never lost hope in his fight against cancer until his last day, teaching me the value of perseverance through life's greatest challenges, which has influenced me to keep going with finishing my master's thesis, even surrounded by deep sadness.

Finally, I would like to thank the rest of my family and friends for always believing in me and for their patience, encouragement, and unconditional love throughout this journey.
